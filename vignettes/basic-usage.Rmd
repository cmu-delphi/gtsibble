`gtsibble` depends on the `delphi-utils` python package. Prior to installing the package, it is recommended that you try to set up your own python environment via `reticulate`. Installing `gtsibble` will attempt to set-up a python environment however manual installation might be required.  


```{r setup}
library(gtsibble)
library(covidcast)
library(epiprocess)
```

`gtsibble` requires setting up `delphi-utils`  

```{r}
load_delphi_utils()
```
